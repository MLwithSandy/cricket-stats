        &nbspThe Ireland cricket team represents all of Ireland in international
        cricket. The Irish Cricket Union, operating under the brand Cricket
        Ireland is the sport's governing body in Ireland, and organises the
        international team.

        &nbspOn 22 June 2017, after more than a decade of playing top-class
        international cricket, full ICC membership was granted to Ireland (along
        with Afghanistan) at an ICC meeting in London, thus making them the
        eleventh Test cricket team.

        &nbspIn October 2017, the ICC announced that Ireland's first Test match
        would be at home against Pakistan in May 2018. Ireland played their
        first 'touring' test in India in March 2019 against fellow newcomers
        Afghanistan.
