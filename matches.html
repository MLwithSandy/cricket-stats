      &nbspTest cricket is almost always played as a series of matches between two countries, with all matches in the series taking place in the same country (the host).
    </p>
    <p>
      A Test match will produce a result by means of one of six scenarios:

      <div class="team-list">
        <li>All four innings are complete</li>
        &nbsp
        <li>The team batting in the fourth innings overtakes the opposing team's run total</li>
        &nbsp
        <li>The third innings concludes with the team that batted twice still trailing the team that batted once</li>
        &nbsp
        <li>Time for the match expires without a result being reached</li>
        &nbsp
        <li>The match is abandoned because the ground is declared unfit for play</li>
        &nbsp
        <li>The match is awarded through a forfeiture</li>
