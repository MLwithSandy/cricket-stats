      &nbspA Test match may have following outcomes: Won, Lost or Undecided (Tied or Draw). A test match may have definitive result by means of one of six scenario:
      <div class="team-list">
        <li>All four innings are complete</li>
        <li>The team batting in the fourth innings overtakes the opposing team's run total</li>
        <li>The third innings concludes with the team that batted twice still trailing the team that batted once</li>
        <li>Time for the match expires without a result being reached</li>
        <li>The match is abandoned because the ground is declared unfit for play</li>
