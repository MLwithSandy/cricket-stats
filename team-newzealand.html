        &nbspThe New Zealand national cricket team represents New Zealand in
        men's international cricket. Nicknamed the Black Caps, they played their
        first Test in 1930 against England in Christchurch, becoming the fifth
        country to play Test cricket.

        &nbspFrom 1930 New Zealand had to wait until 1956, more than 26 years,
        for its first Test victory, against the West Indies.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbspOn 4 April 1996, New Zealand achieved a unique world record, where
        the whole team was adjudged Man of the Match for team performance
        against 4 run victory over the West Indies. This is recorded as the only
        time where whole team achieved such an award.
      </p>

        &nbspNew Zealand won the inaugural ICC World Test Championship
        tournament in 2021, beating India by 8 wickets. The team is currently
        ranked 1st in Tests, 1st in ODIs and 3rd in T20Is by the ICC.
