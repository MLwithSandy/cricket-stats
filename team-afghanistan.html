        &nbspThe Afghanistan men's national team represents Afghanistan in
        international cricket.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbspCricket has been played in Afghanistan since the mid-19th century,
        but it was only in the early 21st century that the national team began
        to enjoy success. The Afghanistan Cricket Board was formed in 1995 and
        became an affiliate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in
        2001
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbspOn 22 June 2017, at an ICC meeting in London, full ICC Membership
        (and therefore Test status) was granted to Afghanistan. Alongside
        Ireland, this took the number of Test cricket playing nations to twelve.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbspThe team is ranked 9th in Twenty20 International (T20I) cricket as
        of January 2021, and holds the world record for the highest ever T20I
        score, with their score of 278/3 against Ireland at Dehradun on 23
        February 2019.
