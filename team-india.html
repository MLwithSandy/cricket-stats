        &nbspThe India men's national cricket team, also known as Team India and
        Men in Blue,[11] is governed by the Board of Control for Cricket in
        India (BCCI). India had been granted the status of ICC Full Member in
        1932 and they played their inaugural Test match at Lord's in June.

        &nbspFrom 1932 India had to wait until 1952, almost 20 years for its
        first Test victory. In its first fifty years of international cricket,
        India was one of the weaker teams, winning only 35 of the first 196 Test
        matches it played.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbspTraditionally much stronger at home than abroad, the Indian team
        has improved its overseas form, since the start of the 21st century,
        winning Test matches in Australia, England and South Africa. They are
        also one of the only four teams to win all major ICC.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbspAs of July 4, 2021, India is ranked second in Tests, fourth in ODIs
        and second T20Is by the ICC.
